# Financial Clarity Reporting

## Project Description
Designed a Power BI dashboard to help leadership gain real-time visibility into revenue, expenses, budgets, and profit trends. Automated data refreshes to eliminate manual spreadsheet work and reduce reporting delays. Built role-specific views for executives, finance, and operations to surface the most relevant insights.

The solution became a central hub for financial planning and performance tracking across departments.
